## 📌 About StatsVision

**StatsVision** is a football analytics project focused on **data-driven player comparison** using  
**machine learning and interactive visualizations**.

The project enables:
- 🧤 **Goalkeeper comparison** using GK-specific performance metrics  
- ⚽ **Outfield player comparison** across attacking, passing, and defensive statistics  
- 🔎 **Similar player identification** using machine learning–based distance models  
- 📉 **Dimensionality reduction** of high-dimensional football data using PCA
